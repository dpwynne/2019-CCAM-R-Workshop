# Why Use R?

- "Excel still encourages people to produce bad graphs - in some respects more than in the past because it now offers even more dysfunctional choices."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

- R (with the ggplot2 package) gives you almost total control over every aspect of your graphs

--

- It's harder to do but easier to do *well*!

Four graphs showing the average home price in four ZIP codes in July-September 2019

1) Which of the four graphs is best for this purpose?
2) Is there a better way to display this information?
3) What information is NOT being shown here?

# Overview

Tonight we will create the following graphs:

![](crime_lineplot.png)


---

# Getting Started with R

- Open R Studio

- Open a new script: File `\(\rightarrow\)` New File `\(\rightarrow\)` R Script

--

- All of the work we do tonight will go in this script

---

# Getting Started with R

At the top of your script file, you want to load the R packages you are going to need:


```r
*library(ggplot2)
# Rest of code will go here
```


---

# Getting Started with R

Let's load the data first. We should see three datasets:

- cereal_calories
- housing
- lacrime2017

--


```r
library(readr)
cereal &lt;- read_csv("cereal_calories.csv")
housing &lt;- read_csv("housing.csv")
crime &lt;- read_csv("lacrime2017.csv")
```

- Click the `Import Dataset` button to import the data

- Select `From Text (readr)` if that option is available

- Find the file

- In the `Import Options` box, change the names as shown in the code above

---

# Graph Workflow with ggplot2

Start by setting up the graph:

```r 
* ggplot(data = dataset, 
*        mapping = aes(x = x-variable, y = y-variable))
```

--

Then indicate what type of graph to make, e.g.:

```r
* + geom_bar() # for a barplot
* + geom_line() # for a line graph
```

--

Then customize the graph, e.g.:

```r
* + labs() # add or change axis labels
* + theme() # customize elements of the plot
```
--

Save your graph after each step!

--

Once you're happy with your graph, `print` it

---

# Graph Workflow with ggplot2

When in doubt:

- What am I trying to customize?

- Search online for the function and argument that does it

- Add it to your workflow with `+`

---

# Bar Graphs

- Used to compare values between categories

- Most often, the number or proportion of observations in each category

- For BI purposes, often look at a summary value (such as average) in each category

---

# Bar Graphs

For counts, use `geom_bar()`:


```r
zip_bargraph &lt;- ggplot(data = housing, 
                       mapping = aes(x = as.factor(ZipCode))
*                      ) + geom_bar()
print(zip_bargraph)
```
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Bar Graphs

For numbers, use `geom_col()`:


```r
zip_bargraph2 &lt;- ggplot(data = housing, 
                        mapping = aes(x = as.factor(ZipCode), y = Price)
*                       ) + geom_col()
print(zip_bargraph2)
```

![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

- Let's look at the average calories in cereal for each of the four companies in our dataset

- By default, if there are multiple values in the dataset, the graph will add them

- It's easiest to create a separate dataset that contains the averages:

--


```r
library(dplyr)
cereal_averages &lt;- cereal %&gt;% 
  group_by(Manufacturer) %&gt;%
  summarize(Calories = mean(Calories))
```

- If you can't run this code, import the cereal_averages.csv dataset

--

- If you want to know more about how this code works, come back December 5!

---

# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

Now let's set up our graph:

.pull-left[

```r
cereal1 &lt;- ggplot(cereal_averages, 
                  aes(x = Manufacturer, y = Calories)) + 
           geom_col()
print(cereal1)
```
]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---
# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

Let's fix a couple of things here.

First, let's change the code to add color.

.pull-left[

```r
cereal1 &lt;- ggplot(cereal_averages, 
                  aes(x = Manufacturer, y = Calories)) + 
*geom_col(aes(fill = Manufacturer))
print(cereal1)
```

- Adding colors added a legend!

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---
# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

Let's fix a couple of things here.

Next, let's reorder the bars.

.pull-left[

```r
cereal1 &lt;- ggplot(cereal_averages, 
*                 aes(x = reorder(Manufacturer, Calories),
                      y = Calories)) + 
geom_col(aes(fill = Manufacturer))
print(cereal1)
```

- The `reorder` command changes the bar order

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

Once the plot is set up correctly, we can just add customization to the already saved plot!

Let's start by renaming axis labels:

.pull-left[

```r
cereal2 &lt;- cereal1 + 
* labs(x = "", y = "Calories")
print(cereal2)
```

]


.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

???

In general we want to label our axes. However, when the category labels make the x-axis variable obvious, don't waste the space by adding the label

---
# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

Once the plot is set up correctly, we can just add customization to the already saved plot!

And now add a title:

.pull-left[

```r
cereal3 &lt;- cereal2 + 
* ggtitle("Average Calories by Cereal Manufacturer")
print(cereal3)
```

]


.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---
# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

Now let's fix the colors. I like to use a color-blind palette&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:


```r
cbPalette &lt;- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
```

.pull-left[

```r
cereal4 &lt;- cereal3 + 
* scale_fill_manual(values = cbPalette[c(1,1,1,7)])
print(cereal4)
```

]


.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

# Interlude: A Note on Color

- Color should be used to *distinguish* and/or *emphasize*

- If color is simply cosmetic, black and white is always better!&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
[1] Except when bosses demand color
]

--

.pull-left[

- What purpose does color serve in this graph?

.pull-right[

![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]



---
# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

Finally, we have some cleaning to do:

- Get rid of the legend

.pull-left[

```r
cereal5 &lt;- cereal4 + 
* guides(fill = FALSE)
print(cereal5)
```

]


.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]


---
# Example: Creating a Bar Graph

Finally, we have some cleaning to do:

- Center the title

.pull-left[

```r
cereal6 &lt;- cereal5 + 
* theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
print(cereal6)
```

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Reading a Bar Graph

- Compare the heights of the bars to compare the categories

- The bars in the bar graph *must* start at 0 for the heights of the bars to be comparable

![](cereal_barplot.png)

???

With `ggplot2` it's essentially impossible to create a misleading graph!

---

# Depicting Relationships

- Can use either points or lines

- Use points to show relationships between two variables

- Use lines to show changes over time

---

# Scatterplots

- Use `geom_point()` to draw the points

- Use `geom_jitter()` if the points tend to overlap


```r
sqft_scatter &lt;- ggplot(data = housing, 
                        mapping = aes(x = SqFt, y = Price)
*                       ) + geom_jitter()
print(sqft_scatter)
```

![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

???

You will sacrifice some accuracy but be able to better see the trend

---

# Line Graphs

- Use `geom_line()` to draw the line


```r
housing.month &lt;- housing %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;% summarize(AvgPrice = mean(Price))
housing_linegraph &lt;- ggplot(data = housing.month, 
                        mapping = aes(x = Month, y = AvgPrice)
*                       ) + geom_line()
print(housing_linegraph)
```


![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Example: Creating a Line Graph

- Let's look at crime trends for four crimes (battery, burglary, vehicle theft, and identity theft) in 2017 in Los Angeles

- This data is in the `crime` dataset we imported earlier


```r
print(crime)
```

```
## # A tibble: 48 x 3
##    month `Crime Name`   ncrimes
##    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1     1 Burglary          1301
##  2     1 Identity Theft    1131
##  3     1 Vehicle Theft     1755
##  4     1 Battery           1369
##  5     2 Burglary          1173
##  6     2 Identity Theft     912
##  7     2 Vehicle Theft     1462
##  8     2 Battery           1315
##  9     3 Burglary          1266
## 10     3 Identity Theft    1141
## # ... with 38 more rows
```

---

# Example: Creating a Line Graph

Just like last time, let's start by setting up our graph:

.pull-left[

```r
crime1 &lt;- ggplot(crime, 
                  aes(x = month, y = ncrimes)) + 
           geom_line()
print(crime1)
```

- Line graphs just connect the dots in row order

- We need to split up so we get one line per crime type

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Example: Creating a Line Graph

Let's pass a `color` aesthetic to `geom_line` to indicate that we want different color lines for each crime type:

.pull-left[

```r
crime2 &lt;- ggplot(crime, 
                  aes(x = month, y = ncrimes)) + 
*          geom_line(aes(color = `Crime Name`))
print(crime2)
```
]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Example: Creating a Line Graph

You can change the default look of the plot background and axis using `theme`s:

.pull-left[

```r
crime3 &lt;- crime2 + 
* theme_bw()
print(crime3)
```

- I like `theme_bw()` and `theme_minimal()`

- The main difference is that `bw` adds a black frame around the graph

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Example: Creating a Line Graph

The most obvious issue is that months are shown as numbers:


```r
month.labels &lt;- c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")
```

.pull-left[

```r
crime4 &lt;- crime3 + 
* scale_x_continuous(
*   breaks = seq(1,12),
*   labels = month.labels
    ) 
print(crime4)
```

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Example: Creating a Line Graph

This created another issue: we have phantom gridlines that don't mean anything.

.pull-left[

```r
crime5 &lt;- crime4 + 
* theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
print(crime5)
```

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]



---

# Example: Creating a Line Graph

Now, let's fix our axis labels and add a title:

.pull-left[

```r
crime6 &lt;- crime5 + 
* labs(x = "", y = "Number of Crimes") +
* ggtitle("Crime in 2017 in Los Angeles")
print(crime6)
```

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]


???

Note here that the month is now intuitive, and so we don't need an axis label

---

# Example: Creating a Line Graph

Finally, let's fix the legend:

.pull-left[

```r
crime7 &lt;- crime6 + 
* scale_color_manual(name = "",
*                    breaks = c("Battery","Vehicle Theft","Burglary", "Identity Theft"),
*                    values = cbPalette[c(1,2,3,4)])

print(crime7)
```

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Reading a Line Graph

- Look at general and seasonal trends within lines

- Compare location and trend between lines using the same y-axis

- Look for unusually low/high values or values that don't fit the trend

![](crime_lineplot.png)

---

# Beyond Today

- Instead of using color, you can use `facet_wrap` to create one pane for each category or `facet_grid` to create a grid of panes at combinations of categories:

.pull-left[

```r
crime_facet &lt;- crime1 + 
* facet_wrap(~`Crime Name`)
print(crime_facet)
```


- With smart use of color/line types and faceting, you can display up to 3 categorical variables on your line graph!

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Beyond Today

- You can use the `annotate` command to add text, lines, and other things on top of the graph:

.pull-left[

```r
crime_annotated &lt;- crime7 + 
* annotate(geom = "text",
*          x = 11, y = 900,
*          label = "Identity Theft\nGoing Down"
  )
print(crime_annotated)
```
]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

- Placing annotations can involve a lot of trial-and-error!

---

# Beyond Today

- The default ggplot2 font size is way too small for presentations

- Use `theme` with `element_text(size = )` to change the font size:

.pull-left[

```r
cereal_fontsize &lt;- cereal5 + 
* theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
*       axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,
*                                 size = 24)
        )
print(cereal_fontsize)
```

]

.pull-right[
![](2019-11-14-DataVisualizationWorkshop_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Beyond Today

- The default ggplot2 font size is way too small for presentations

- Use `theme` with `element_text(size = )` to change the font size:

.pull-left[

```r
crime_fontsize &lt;- crime7 + 
* theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
*       axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,
                                  size = 24),
*       legend.text = element_text(size = 14)
        )
print(crime_fontsize)

# Presenting with Graphs

- Your audience typically has a limited idea of your data and why it's important.

- Walking an audience through a graph is an art form, but there is a structure to it.

--

- I walk my audiences through graphs in this order:

1. Subject

1. Features

1. Highlights

---

# Subject

- *Never* jump in immediately with the point you want to make!

- You need to quickly make sure everyone understands *what* you have graphed

--

Even if it's just filler, your audience will appreciate the pause to take in the graph with their own eyes

Before you can tell the audience where to direct their attention, you have to tell them what they are attending to!

---
# Highlights 

- Now that you have oriented your audience, you can easily bring their attention to the parts of the graph you want to highlight

- Often it helps to literally point these things out (using a finger or laser pointer)!

- Focus on highlighting:

--

1. Important values/trends

--

1. Unusual or unexpected values/trends

--

1. Differences in values/trends between groups

# A Note on Actionable Takeaways

- This step often requires going beyond just the information in your graphs

- You may have neither the information nor responsibility necessary to provide actionable takeaways

- Often, your job is to break down complex data so that the people who *do* have the information and responsibility can do their job
